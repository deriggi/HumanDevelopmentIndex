# Dendrogram For the Human Developnent Index
The [HDI Dataset](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdi_series_cartagena.xlsx) from UNDP has a lot of great country level data for the world. This is a datset with several variables for each country which is great but how do you sort something with several variables? One technique is to use clustering. We can pretend for a moment that the variables are dimensions in physical space, like a familiar x,y,z coordinate space and then plot the countries to see where they bunch together. Each bunch is deemed a cluster

The next stop is figuring out what the clusters are and that is where dendrograms can help
